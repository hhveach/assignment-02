				<h1>Hello.</h1>
				<p>Mark Boulton Design was a small design studio. In 2014, <a href="www.monotype.com">we
					were acquired by Monotype</a>.</p>
				<p>Over the years, we <a href="team.com">built an amazing team</a> and worked on some
			     <a href="clients.com">tremendous projects with the smartest clients</a>. That's something
				   we're proud of, and thankful for. But, it's time for a change.</p>
				<p>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the  problems we want to
				   fix. Mark Boulton Design is now closed. The team will be working
				   on Monotype projects from the same premises in the UK and we'll
				   still be writing, still blogging, and still speaking at Web
				   conferences. We're not going anywhere.</p>
